# L/D-toggle

A light/dark toggle switch
-to switch between light and dark colors
-a practice application for the social media dashboard to be built later
-custom properties to be created in CSS (:root)
-toggle to be functional via Javascript

After practicing and going along with the tutorial from the Online Tutorials Youtube channel,
I discovered that the custom properties feature is not necessary, at least not according to
this channel. I will, however, practice some more on the light/dark toggle switch until it becomes
second nature to me using various methods (Online Tutorials method not withstanding).
